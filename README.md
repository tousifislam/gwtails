# gwtails

This is a Python package to analyze post-merger late-time tails in eccentric binary black hole (BBH) mergers. 

This code is based on the paper "Phenomenology and origin of late-time tails in eccentric binary black hole mergers" by Islam, Faggioli, Khanna, Field, van de Meent and Buonanno. Here, we inspect waveforms produced by merging eccentric binary black holes (BBH) in . These waveforms are all generated using black hole perturbation theory. The trajectories are described by the dynamics of the point-particle orbiting the Kerr black hole using effective-one-body formalism: http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9811091, http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0001013, http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19006. These trajectories are then fed into the time-domain Teukolsky solver developed by Gaurav Khanna and collaborators: http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0703028, http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0317, http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0317, http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0485, http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1816, http://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:2010.04760.
